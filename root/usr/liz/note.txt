I can hear Murtaugh breaching the defenses of my ship. It is the high time for me to leave this dimension.

I'm sorry I couldn't wait for you any longer, but I fear that with one more karma portal placed this dimension will collapse entirely.

I know what he wants to do. I know why he came back to the core. He's after those who buried him alive in that lighthouse.

I have to warn them. I have to get to the fifth layer. I wish you could follow me but I have only one rescue pod left.

I am sorry.

Elizabeth.
