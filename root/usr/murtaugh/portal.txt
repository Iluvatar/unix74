so here it is.

I did draw a portal in here, however it's not stable. I'm going
to use it, even though I can't tell where I'll end up.

Feel free to use this door whenever you like, just remember that
the number of places it can take you to is beyond wildest
imagination.

Or I'm just trying to keep you from exiting the lighthouse.

Either way - decide for yourself if you're going to use it or
not.
