live my life peacefully not
disturbing anyone. The job of a Lighthouse keeper seemed to be
just right for me. And I wanted to spend the rest of my life in
that lighthouse. But after five months my isolation came to an
end when they decided to bury the building. My worst fear ever
was to be buried alive. But what about to be buried alive inside
of a building? I didn't want to take any chances. So I'm leaving
today.

For those who follow me:

I am sorry...

and

m = 247

sincerely
