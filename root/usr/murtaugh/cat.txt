Today a strangest thing has happened. When I woke up there was a
black cat inside the lighthouse. I clearly remember locking all
the doors and windows before going to bed - yet - there he was. I
have no idea how he could get inside. That bothers me. I named
him Einstein, since he's apparently capable of breaking the time
and space barrier as he wishes. Probably all cats do, but this
particular one did that in front of my very eyes. Well, not
exactly, but it's undeniable that he's here now. Just wondering
if that has anything to do with my ability to build cross-
dimension door with my karma arm. Guess we'll see in time.
