Hi Elizabeth.

Even in my strangest dreams I never thought that I would be able
to create through dimensional pathways leading to new unexplored
places. My new experiment took me right below the lighthouse
straight to those legendary ruins. You can call me a discoverer
from now on. And I only used that wisdom gem that I found lately.
Just think where possibly I could go using the lighthouse itself
and its full power of light.

I'm considering moving to another place next 32 days.

Will you take care of Einstein for me?

Yours
